## Important Points to Remember

- Whenever there's a string or array problem think or brute force solution first and then try to optimize it.
- Optimization can usually be done using two pointes, sliding window, or prefix sum.
- If you want to group string anamgrams you can convert their charCount arrays into
strings and use them as keys in a hashmap.
